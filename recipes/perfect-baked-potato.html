    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Start off by rinsing and scrubbing the potatoes. Then, pierce each potato
      with a fork or knife so that steam can escape when baking. Coat the potato
      with olive oil (you can use your hands to rub it all over the skin or
      place the potato and oil in a zip-top bag and shake it up) and season with
      salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bake in a 300 degree F oven until the potatoes are tender and golden
      brown, about 90 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slice the potatoes and fluff the center. Then top with black pepper,
      butter, Cheddar cheese, chives, sour cream, or anything else you like.
    </p>

      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Scrub the potato, and
        pierce the skin several times with a knife or fork. Rub the skin with
        olive oil, then with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the potato in the preheated oven, and bake until slightly soft and

        serve with butter and black pepper. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese
        over the top, if desired.
